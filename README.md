# ambulance_location_model
This project was submitted for Modelling course in Aberdeen University. Our group has used Google API and Wolfram API to model where is the best location for extra ambulance stations in Aberdeen.
- [Report](https://github.com/justsvykas/ambulance_location_model/blob/main/Report.pdf)
- Power point [slides](https://github.com/justsvykas/ambulance_location_model/blob/main/Modelling%20_Ambulance%20Response%20Times.pptx)
- [Code.ipynb](https://github.com/justsvykas/ambulance_location_model/blob/main/Modelling_Ambulance_locations_final.ipynb) was used to arrive at the results found in report

## Simplified
Our work is outlined as follows:
- Scraped most addresses of Aberdeen city and shire
- Pre-processed them into Geo coordinates
- Predicted ambulance response times while varying time and week-day
- Analysed data and arrived at conclusion where extra ambulance station would decrease response time most

Important to say that the conclusions has biases due to the nature of data. Such as population density is not equal to address density
